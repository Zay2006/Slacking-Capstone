```javascript
app.message(async ({ message, client, say }) => {
  if (message.subtype === 'bot_message') return;
  
  const isBotMentioned = message.text && message.text.includes(`<@${app.botId}>`);
  const isDirectMessage = message.channel_type === 'im';
  
  if (isDirectMessage || isBotMentioned) {
    try {
      // Show typing indicator to the user who sent the message
      await client.chat.postEphemeral({
        channel: message.channel,
        user: message.user,
        text: "Thinking..."
      });
      
      const userMessage = message.text ? 
        message.text.replace(/<@[A-Z0-9]+>/g, '').trim() : '';
        
      // Get response from OpenAI
      const response = await generateAIResponse(userMessage);
      
      // Post the response to the channel (visible to everyone)
      await client.chat.postMessage({
        channel: message.channel,
        text: response
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error handling message:", error);
      await client.chat.postMessage({
        channel: message.channel,
        text: "Sorry, I encountered an error processing your request."
      });
    }
  }
});
```

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Challenges

**Challenge 1: OpenAI API Integration**

Integrating with the OpenAI API initially presented challenges with handling API keys containing special characters. The standard dotenv library wasn't correctly parsing these keys, leading to authentication failures. This was overcome by implementing a custom file parser that properly handles special characters and creates a more robust environment variable loading mechanism.

**Challenge 2: Real-time Message Processing**

Ensuring messages were processed in the correct order while maintaining typing indicators proved difficult. The solution was to implement an ephemeral message pattern that shows typing indicators only to the user who triggered the action, while ensuring the final response is visible to everyone in the channel.

**Challenge 3: Interactive UI Components**

Implementing interactive buttons with proper action handlers required deep understanding of Slack's Block Kit and action handling patterns. This was resolved by creating separate action handlers and properly structuring the event response flow.

### AI Implementation Insights

- Providing clear system instructions dramatically improved response quality
- Setting appropriate temperature values (0.7) balanced creativity with accuracy
- Implementing safety checks for undefined message content prevented many potential runtime errors
- Direct API calls provided more control than using wrapper libraries

### What Went Well

- Modular architecture allowed for clean separation of concerns
- Socket Mode implementation eliminated the need for public endpoints during development
- Block Kit UI provided engaging, interactive user experience
- Error handling mechanisms ensured graceful degradation when issues occurred

### What Could Be Improved

- Add comprehensive test coverage for all components
